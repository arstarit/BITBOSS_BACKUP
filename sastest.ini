0x01=Shutdown Command
This command is used to make the gaming machine unplayable. Situations where a gaming
machine may be disabled include preparing for casino maintenance, ROM Signature mismatch,
jurisdictional requirements, etc.

If a gaming machine receives a Shutdown command, it should
disable all user inputs except "cash out" and "change/attendant." The gaming machine can
either automatically cash out any accumulated credits or allow the user to cash them out.

If an active gaming machine receives the shutdown command, it must first complete the current
game cycle, including an double up sequences. If there are any pending bonus awards, they
are awarded upon the completion of the game along with and base game win. The win results in
a machine handpay condition, the handpay condition is processed and reset normally. Once the gaming
machine has completed processing the current game, it disables itself and detailed above.

0x13=Total Drop Meter
This meter includes, at a minimum total credits received by the
game from the bill acceptor, plus total credits from coins dropped by the game, plus,
total credits from all tickets redeemed (stacked) by the gaming machine. The fact that tickets are
included in total drop must be indicated in the long poll A0 response. Used during
hard count and soft count reconciliation.
END

BEGIN = $14
0x14=Total Jackpot Meter
The cumulative sum of all credits paid by an attendant as a result of winning wagers
and awards from an external bonusing system. This includes handpays resulting
from progressive jackpots, bonus pays and/or game wins regardless of whether or not
the win is one of the top jackpots. Credits added to this meter are NOT added to the
total coin out meter. While jurisdictional rules may dictate the criteria by which won
credits are metered in either coin out or jackpot, the sum of total coin out and total
jackpot must always equal total won credits. Credits accounted for in the hand paid
cancelled credits meter are never added to this meter. Used as a component of the
estimated win for a gaming machine and to reconcile metered payment with actual
payments.
END

BEGIN = $15
0x15 - Games Played Meter
